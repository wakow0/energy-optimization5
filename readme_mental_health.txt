1. Simulate What People Say and How They Sound
We create fake sentences that mimic how people might describe their feelings (e.g., "I feel sad, anxious, joyful").

We also generate fake numbers that represent features of their voice (e.g., tone, pitch — like how high or low they sound). These are what AI systems would learn from real speech recordings.

2. Clean and Convert the Words into Numbers
The computer doesn't understand words like "happy" or "depressed" directly.

So we use a method called TF-IDF that turns each sentence into a list of numbers based on how important each word is.

3. Combine Text and Speech
We put together the numbers from the text and from the speech to create a full "profile" of a person’s expression.

4. Train the AI Model
We show the computer lots of examples of what people "sounded" like when they were either okay (no risk) or showing early signs of mental health concerns (at-risk).

The computer tries to learn patterns that help it guess who might need mental health support.

5. Test the AI Model
We give it some new fake profiles it hasn’t seen before.

Then we check: how many people did it correctly identify as needing help vs. missing?

6. Evaluate Fairness
Finally, we simulate how well the AI works for different groups — for example, men vs. women — to check if it’s fair and not biased.

This is a small demo that proves we can combine text and speech to train an AI system to spot mental health signals early — and we can also check if it's fair, transparent, and useful.
